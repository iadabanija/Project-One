    <h3>Little History about Harry S Truman College</h3>

    <video src="media/harrystrumancollege-collegetocareers.mp4" controls></video>
    <section>
    <p>
    At Harry S Truman College, we believe that the path to success begins with an education.
    Under City Colleges of Chicago’s Reinvention plan, whether a student’s goal is to move immediately
    into the workforce or transfer to a four-year college, our faculty, staff and administration work
    to provide students with the support and tools necessary to succeed.

    <h3>EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS</h3>
    </article>
    <section>
    <p>Under City Colleges of Chicago's strategic Reinvention initative, Harry S Truman College continues
    to grow and evolve, again proving itself in FY2015 - our most recently completed fiscal year - as a
    premiere urban college and a generator of educations of economic value for its students. In bringing
    together CCC's resources to create a College to Careers (C2C) hub for Education, Human and Natural
    Sciences on our campus, we continue to proudly state that Truman College is an institution of higher
    education where the best teachers are teaching the teachers of tomorrow how to be the best.</p>

    <P>Our success is the success of our students experience, much of which is reflected in our most
    recent Five Year Plan Scorecard. In FY2015, Truman College met or exceeded 11 of the 18 ambitious
    targets set for it, coming within 95% of a 12th goal. These included exceeding the college's target
    graduation rate that has grown by an even wider margin than before; exceeding the target for the total
    number of degrees and certificates awarded; remediation efforts that led to a signficantly greater number
    of students advancing to college-level courses than projected; a continued rise in the number of student
    transfering to four year-insitutions; and exceeding the target goal for C2C program enrollment.</P>
