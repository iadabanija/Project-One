  <h2>About me</h2>
  
  <img src = "media/pic.jpeg" alt = "my pic">
<p>My name is Idris Adabanija, I was born in Osun State, Nigeria. I am from the western part of Nigeria (Yoruba). I was born into the family of 3, which am the second child.</p>

<p>I came to the United state in 2015, and i attended Harry S Truman College.</p>

<p>My college life was a bit challenging because I had difficulties adjusting to the educational system. I graduated from Truman College in 2018 with a GPA of 3.5, with High Honor.</p>

<p>While at Truman college, I joined Phi theta Kappa in 2017, and I received 3 Honor of Dean List and a presidential scholar.</p>

<p>I got admission to the Illinois Institute of Technology as a third year undergraduate to gain a bachelor of science in Information Technology Management.</p>

<p>To be able to achieve all I have now, I will not a hesitate mention my family that are so supportive. Eespecially my Dad who pays for my tuition.</p>

<p>They taught me about what life they have given me, how they want me to be educated and be a man that will be part of a progressive society.</p>

<p>Life have been kind of easy for me because i have families who i rely on to guide me, so i can be able to accomplish my set goals.</p>

<p>My set goal is to become a web designer and application developer, so i contribute to my country and the society at large.</P>
